The Adicia team is building a unique virtual world where players can play, own, and monetize content and gaming experiences. This will be Play To Earn (P2E) game similar to Minecraft or Sandbox but with a user generated Puzzle content like Optical Illusion and Mechanical Puzzle. <br />

#### Web App
User can play this Game on [Web] (https://adikia.netlify.app/). <br />
 
#### Video
This Puzzle's demonstration video is available at (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St6gajbpMg8) 
## Description
This is a Voxel based puzzle game. The First Puzzle is based on optical Illusion similar to monument valley where user can manipulate impossible architecture and Second Puzzle is based on Physics (looking around, turning keys, and activating switches).This involve exploration of fantastic architecture and impossible geometry.

## Monument/Architecture Design
Inspired by minimalist 3D design, optical illusions and palaces and temples from around the world, every monument is a unique, hand-crafted world to explore. User can create NFTs using voxel based Monuments/Architecture. <br />
Twist and drag to reshape the world and help User to explore. Designed to be easy for everyone to pick up, enjoy and complete. <br />
Journeys through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects, which are referred to as "sacred geometry" in-game, as she journeys to be forgiven for something.<br />
The game is presented in isometric view and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as user progresses to the map's exit. <br />
Interactions include Twisting monuments, moving platforms and pillars, and creating bridges, moving ancient mechanics. <br />
Voxel based design make it easier to design the enviroment and architecture. 

## Mystery Physics Puzzle
It also has physics based puzzle similar to Room where the player with a series of strange puzzle boxes that feature a number of physical mechanisms. <br />
The player is challenged to figure out how to open each one – typically by undoing a series of locks – to access another puzzle box within it. <br />
The game uses a variety of motions enabled by mobile device touchscreens to simulate actions in real life, such as looking around the device, turning keys, and activating switches. 

# Future RoadMap
## Build Voxel Game Maker
1- Templates of Open world will be available which can costomized according to User's needs. They can also import Voxel Assets from any voxel editor or from web and can Use them to make Open World of their Choice. They can sell them into NFT MarketPlace and monetize them.

2- To build different types of Puzzle, Script will be needed. For Players with no technical knowledge, there will be several Templates of different Puzzle like:- <br/>
-  Optical Illusion <br />
-  Physics Based Puzzle (Finding Clue, sliding Puzzle, Combination Puzzle, Match3, jigsaw <br />
-  Board game (Hitman Go) <br />
-  Point and Click game <br />
-  Card battle game <br />
-  City Builder (construct building, gather resources defence kingdom) <br />
-  Tower defence <br />
-  Turn Based game <br />
- RPG adventure <br />
<b>These templates will be inside the Game Maker.Users can Change the variable parameters of the script or Add multiple instances of same template/script to make complex Puzzle.</b> <br />
User can Combine different Templates/Script to make Innovative Games inside the Metaverse. 

3- Visual Editor(similar to Unity Bolt) for game where User use visual scripting like Powerful flow control graphs (similar to Unreal Blueprints) for low-level logic and complex tasks. Elegant finite state machines (FSM) for high-level logic and easy state management. Create and modify entire graphs while in Play mode. <br />
It's  unique runtime will save and propagate your changes, allowing you to prototype and build your game while playing it. <br />

## MarketPlace
1- The NFT Game Marketplace is an NFT marketplace where you can search and buy creator's ASSETS with Token to incorporate them into your Game. <br />
2- Creator can build game with different assets and templates and monetize them by listing in the MarketPlace. <br />
3- Creator can list both the Assets and Game in the NFT Marketplace and Monetize them according to their Ratings.
4- The NFT Marketpalce is
