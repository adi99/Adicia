# Adicia
Voxel Based Puzzle Game where Users can explore the world and play different type of Puzzle like optical illusion and Puzzle box with  sophisticated mechanics 

# This is a Voxel based puzzle game. The First Puzzle is based on optical Illusion similar to monument valley where user can manipulate impossible architecture and Second Puzzle is based on Physics (looking around, turning keys, and activating switches).This involve exploration of fantastic architecture and impossible geometry.

# Monument/Architecture Design
Inspired by minimalist 3D design, optical illusions and palaces and temples from around the world, every monument is a unique, hand-crafted world to explore. User can create NFTs using voxel based Monuments/Architecture.
Twist and drag to reshape the world and help User to explore. Designed to be easy for everyone to pick up, enjoy and complete.
Journeys through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects, which are referred to as "sacred geometry" in-game, as she journeys to be forgiven for something. The game is presented in isometric view and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as user progresses to the map's exit.
Interactions include Twisting monuments, moving platforms and pillars, and creating bridges, moving ancient mechanics.
Voxel based design make it easier to design the enviroment and architecture.

# Mystery Physics Puzzle
It also has physics based puzzle similar to Room where the player with a series of strange puzzle boxes that feature a number of physical mechanisms. 
The player is challenged to figure out how to open each one – typically by undoing a series of locks – to access another puzzle box within it. 
The game uses a variety of motions enabled by mobile device touchscreens to simulate actions in real life, such as looking around the device, turning keys, and activating switches.
